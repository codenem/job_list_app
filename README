Requirements:  node.js (to install bower)

Installation: 
	Just cd to the root folder and execute 'bower install'

	Open index.html with Chrome (I didn't test on FF nor IE).

Note that you must launch Chrome with the â€“allow-file-acces-from-files flag enabled for it to work locally (and all other instances of Chrome closed). For more details:
